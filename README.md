# Snake-Doubly-Linked-List



This program is a classic game of snake. The limit variable determines the speed, the lower the limit, the faster
fewer frames inbetween screen updates. The head of the snake is controlled using WASD, and when the snake eats
a yellow piece of food, it gets bigger. If the snake hits itself or the edge of the screen, the game ends.
